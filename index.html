                        Our research focused on discrete choice models and stochastic traffic equilibrium. We
                        worked on to make use of robust optimization techniques to define and model the distributionally
                        robust traffic equilibrium as a new convex optimization formulation which is provably
                        efficiently solvable and has the flexibility of allowing for general marginal distributions.

                    Air transportation has been a very important sector due to its operational and economical aspects.
                    In this growing industry, airlines try to analyze a very large and complex network in order to
                    plan their operations. However, operations cannot be operated as scheduled due to irregularities in
                    operations, namely disruptions. Original schedules of aircraft, crew members and passengers become
                    infeasible; and airlines try to recover their schedules with minimum disruption and recovery costs.
                    Moreover, due to the dynamic nature of the operations, operation controllers need to take action
                    in real time; which makes the rescheduling efforts more challenging.
                    <span class="btnmore">more</span>
                    <span class="more">
                        The traditional approach is to recover the schedules of aircraft, crew members and passengers
                        sequentially. The reports show that the sequential approach results in high recovery costs and
                        passenger inconvenience. In the first part of our study, we integrate passenger recovery and
                        cruise
                        speed control with aircraft rescheduling. A special emphasis is placed on passenger recovery. In
                        our
                        experiments, we observed that integration of cruise speed control option helps mitigate delays
                        and
                        create new swap opportunities, which is one of the most common recovery actions in practical
                        disruption management. The problem is initially formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear
                        programming
                        (MINLP) model. We reformulate the problem
                        as a conic quadratic mixed integer programming (CQMIP) problem. We were able to solve about 93%
                        of
                        the instances of a large airline network to optimality within 60 seconds. In the second part, we
                        propose a new general network representation of the problem that can integrate any entity that
                        is
                        transported through the flight network of the airline. We show that the proposed representation
                        is
                        more compact than the traditional time-space network and flight string representations. The
                        flexibility of the representation allows to integrate all possible recovery actions together
                        with
                        the cruise speed control which is studied by a few authors only. We investigated and created
                        disruption scenarios with varying severities using the real data of a major airline company.
                        Moreover, we propose new realistic passenger delay cost formulations. Finally, we propose a
                        CQMIP
                        formulation of the integrated airline recovery problem using the proposed representation.
                        Proposed
                        approach was able to find the best recovery actions of a major U.S. airline within reasonable
                        solution times. In the final part, using the flexibility of the proposed representation, we
                        propose
                        a heuristic approach to provide fast and good solutions to very large airline networks. The
                        heuristic utilizes the advantages of rescheduling and relies on the fact that the original
                        schedules
                        are optimal provided that there are no disruptions. The algorithm uses the interdependencies
                        among
                        the recovery actions defined by the proposed networks to quickly reduce the problem size and
                        find a
                        subset of eligible recovery actions. The heuristic aims to find the best reduced feasible region
                        that provides a solution within the predetermined time limit. For large instances with severe
                        disruptions that are optimized within around two hours, proposed approach provides solutions
                        with
                        about 4.69% more costs within five minutes.

                    A two-sided assembly line is a special type of assembly lines which is mainly used in production
                    of large products such as trucks and buses. Two-sided assembly line balancing problem (TSALBP)
                    is relatively a recent type of assembly line balancing problems. In addition to common constraints
                    of assembly lines, a subset of the tasks in TSALBP also have side constraints.

                        In the first part of
                        our study, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation which uses integer station
                        assignment variables instead of binary variables as used in most proposed formulations in the
                        literature.
                        We were able to provide the very first optimal solutions provided by an exact approach
                        to some benchmark problems. Due to the encouraging results of the mathematical formulation, we
                        propose a rolling-horizon heuristic integrated with the formulation in the second part. The
                        heuristic
                        proceeds on the assembly line solving smaller MIP problems using parameters to control the size
                        of
                        the subproblems and to decide on accepting or rejecting the solutions. The heuristic managed to
                        optimize
                        all benchmark problems within 10800 seconds (a commonly used time limit on the benchmark
                        problems). In the third part, we proposed a second heuristic approach to provide fast solutions.
                        We
                        have been inspired by the multiple-rule heuristic of Boctor (1995). The proposed heuristic is an
                        enhanced version in the sense that it uses a greater number of logical rules and their
                        combinations;
                        and the rules are designed to handle side constraints. The polynomial time heuristic was able to
                        achieve optimal solutions to the largest data sets within 30 seconds.
